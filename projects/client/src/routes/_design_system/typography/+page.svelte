  <h1>Lurking in the shadows of the CMYK spectrum.</h1>
  <h2>Typography of disintegration, how Garamond lost its serif.</h2>
  <h3>The golden re-ratio: A drunken inquiry into divine proportion.</h3>

    Font pairing: A cautionary tale, or the ballad of Helvetica and Comic Sans.

    The canvas stares back, a blank expanse of terror. Your palette mocks with
    garish pigments, siren songs promising beauty but delivering despair. But
    fear not! Within you lies the spirit of a true artist.

    "They say Helvetica is the font of the future, a typeface so pure it
    transcends emotion. But you know better. You've seen the cracks, the hints
    of despair. You yearn for something with soul."

    a message from the machine gods? Only time will tell.)
